<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Biography</h2>

I am a second-year Ph.D candidate at [SNU Computer Vision Lab](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/) advised by [Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~kmlee/) (Editor in Cheif of [TPAMI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=34)). Before joining [SNU](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), I finished my undergradute degree at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/) and had a wonderful experience at [KAIST VL Lab](https://vllab.kaist.ac.kr/) with [Prof. Seunghoon Hong](https://maga33.github.io/). Also, I worked closely with [Prof. Dongwon Lee](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/dul13) from [The PIKE Group](https://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/) at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/) under collaboration with [Dr. Hye Joon Park](https://www.smeal.psu.edu/management/images/hye-joon-park.jpg/view). 

Since an early age, my great passion lied in automobiles. How they travel from one place to another in multiple scenarios and events was always fascinating. The final goal of my research sits in this childhood dream that one day I can make cars "perceive" and "interact" with the world. Under this mission, my current research interests are as follows:

- **3D Human Mesh Reconstruction:** How to reconstruct human pose and shape from a monocular RGB image/video?
- **3D Scene Reconstruction:** What are the important components of the scene that makes up our world around us?
